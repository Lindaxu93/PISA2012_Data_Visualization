## Dataset

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy. The assessment does not just examine whether students can reproduce what they have learned; it also examines how well they can extrapolate from what they have learned and apply that knowledge in unfamiliar settings, both in and outside of school.

## Summary of Findings

All three scores looks normally distributed, with the mean of about 470. Here does not look to be any significant outliers/spikes, and all distributions are unimodal. The major part of the students gets a score between 300 and 600 in any subject.

2. What is the distribution in terms of number of students in each country?

Most countries have between 5000 to 10000 students to take the survey. The countplot also shows that there are a few countries which are not bounded these limits. For example, Mexico and Italy have over 30,000 students and Liechtenstein has well below 1000 student who participate the survey. 

3. What is the average age of student?

The vast majority of students are between 15 and 16 years old. In the range between 15.4 and 16.1, the distribution resembles a uniform shape. In addtion to that, the gender ratio seems to be balanced out well. There are nearly 15000 students for each biological gender.

4. What are the top performance's countries?

7 out of 10 are from Asian, the other 3 countries are European countries. Students from China-Shanghai has the highest score among other countries, then students from Hong kong as the second, and students from Singapore as the third. 

5. Are there differences in achievement based on gender or country?

In terms of country section, 7 out of 10 are from Asian, the other 3 countries are European countries. Students from China-Shanghai has the highest score among other countries, then students from Hong kong as the second, and students from Singapore as the third. In terms of gender comparison, male students have a slightly higher score on math, while female students have much higher score than male students in terms of reading. For science score, female and male students performe almost the same. In general, the average score of female students are slightly higher than male students.

6. Are there differences in achievement based on internet access?

We found having the accessibility of internet would have a positive impact on student's score even though we have missing data. Therefore, we would recommend student to study in the environment with internet access.

7. Would parents with different nationalities make impact on student's average score, compared with students raised in a homogenous family background?

We found students with parents from different nationalities has a little bit higher score compare to students with parents from same nationalities(country). I am assuming that parents with different cultural background would furthure inspire their children to focus on their studies. However, there's onle a small gap between the two groups, and apprently we have much more sample size of parents with same nationality. Therefore, we need further evidence to support my assumption.


8. What does the graph look like in terms of Country Comparison Grouped By Subject?

The top three regions are China-Shanghai, Singapore, and China-Hongkong. And the top 7 reginons are from Asian. In terms of the individual subject scores, the rankings are differenct compare to the average score. The opposite is the case for Peru that ranks last in all of the categories.

9. What is the correlation between three different scores

In general, the mean scores for maths, reading and science are all positively correlated strongly with one another. This means that a student who is good at maths will usually be strong in science and reading as well, and vice versa. The strongest correlation between the subjects in Mathematics and Science does not seem very surprising.
 
10. What is the average score by subject based on gender? 
Girls score their highest in Reading followed by Science and Math.Boys seem to score their highest in both Science and Math while their least scores are in Reading. In general, there are not too many score differences.
